## **User Experience (UX) Design**  

A user experience designer, **Jesse James Garrett**, introduced five UX design elements in his book *The Elements of User Experience*. This project follows that UX approach.  

### **The Five Planes of UX:**  
1. **Strategy Plane**  
   - The goal is to create a visually appealing, modern, and easy-to-navigate site.  
   - Ensures a seamless user experience for DJs, event organizers, and customers.  

2. **Scope Plane**  
   - The website includes essential features like a **home page, booking form, and contact page**.  

3. **Structure Plane**  
   - The **navigation bar** allows easy switching between pages.  
   - A **clear call-to-action (CTA)** directs users to book a space.  

4. **Skeleton Plane**  
   - The **Bootstrap grid system** is used for layout and responsiveness.  
   - Hover effects and transitions improve user interaction.  

5. **Surface Plane**  
   - The website features a **black and white modern theme**.  
   - Fonts like **Roboto** and **Exo** ensure readability.

### **Home Page**  
- **Header** (Logo + Navigation)  
- **Main Section** (Introduction & Overview)  
- **Feature Grid** (4 boxes highlighting key aspects)  
- **Footer** (Social Media Links)

## **Debugging Process**  
During development, multiple debugging techniques were used to ensure functionality and responsiveness.  

### **Common Issues Found & Fixed:**  
1. **Navigation Bar Responsiveness**  
   - Initially, some elements **overflowed on smaller screens**.  
   - **Fix:** Used **Bootstrap’s grid system** and flex properties.  

2. **Form Alignment Issues**  
   - The booking form fields were **misaligned** on some screen sizes.  
   - **Fix:** Used **Bootstrap columns** for proper alignment.  

3. **Broken Links**  
   - Some social media links **did not open correctly**.  
   - **Fix:** Ensured **valid href attributes** and external link handling.

✅ Used **W3C HTML Validator** to check for syntax errors.  
✅ Ensured proper **nesting of elements** and semantic structure.  
✅ Fixed minor **missing alt attributes** on images.  

### **CSS Validation**
