Welcome to Spinlab, a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project is part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course.

## Introduction

Spinlab is a project for a fictional music and DJ space. Users can navigate through the website using a functional navigation bar. Spinlab offers users information about the business on the home page, a booking form to book a space, and contact information on the contact page.

Thank you for visiting Spinlab.

## UX - User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book *The Elements of User Experience*. In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage. This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### The Strategy Plane

#### Creator Goals
- As a creator, I want the webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want the webpage to be user-friendly and responsive.
- As a creator, I want users to be able to see what the business has to offer immediately (on the home page).
- As a creator, I want users to be motivated to book activities being offered by the business and/or book a table after visiting the webpage.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate across the site to see different pages on the webpage.
- As a user, I want the purpose of the webpage to be clear so I can decide if the content is right for me.
- As a user, I want to see the available activities and drinks menu.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact the business either via phone or online.

User stories are based on online research, personal experience, and my relatives' experiences.

### The Scope Plane

I thought of the features I wanted to implement before designing the project, and a few of them were not achievable within my deadline. I decided to implement the ones covering my user stories first and add the remaining features later.

#### Features implemented upon webpage release
- Home Page with an introduction and an overview of what the space aims to provide.
- Functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.
- Booking form allowing users to book a space.
- Contact page displaying contact information.
- Footer with links to social media.

#### Features planned to add later
- A feature that will send a user an email confirmation after making a reservation or filling out a booking form.
- An additional section showing customer reviews from Google. This will also be added to the home page.
- An additional page for a photo gallery containing photos from activities like DJ sessions and workshops. 

## colors 

The website uses a simple black and white theme to create a clean and modern look. The choice of colors is intended to provide a professional and minimalist aesthetic that is easy on the eyes and enhances readability. The black background helps to make the white text and icons stand out, ensuring that the content is clear and accessible to users.

- **black**: Used for the main background in header, footer and all main sections to provide a consistent and cohesive look.
- **white**: Used for text, social links, and icons to ensure they are easily readable against the darker backgrounds 

This black and white color scheme helps to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.  

## Fonts
Both fonts used in this project are Google Fonts.

- **Roboto**: Used as the main font, as it's one of the most popular and user-friendly fonts. The Roboto font is easy to read even on the smallest devices and provides a positive user experience.
- **Exo**: Used for some headings, the navigation bar, and the menu section. Using a different font for these features helped highlight important sections to the user and made the website easier and quicker to navigate.

## Manual Testing

### Navigation bar
- Fully responsive on large/medium/small resolutions.
- Toggles to a hamburger menu on mobile devices and stays fully responsive.
- All links to pages are working properly.
- Hover CSS is correctly working.

### Footer
- Fully responsive on large/medium/small resolutions.
- Social media links are working.
- Links to pages are working properly.

### Contact form
- Displays contact information as intended.
- Looks good on smaller devices.

## Chrome Dev Tools

Chrome Dev Tools was used throughout the development of the project to test responsiveness. Responsiveness was tested using Dev Tools to emulate the following devices:
- iPhone SE
- iPhone XR
- iPhone 12 Pro
- iPhone 14 Pro Max
- Pixel 7
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
